YSC Thailand is an annual competition founded by Thailand's National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC) and The Science Society of Thailand, with thousands of high school students from all regions of Thailand participating annually. 

To win the competition, participants must pass three rounds: preliminary, semifinals, and finals. 

The requirements for each round are: (as of YSC 2021)
+ Preliminary round: research project proposal
+ Semifinal (regional) round: research paper, introductory video, and poster
+ Final (national) round: research paper, introductory video, poster, presentation before judges

Teams create research projects in one of eight subjects: Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Science, Mathematics, Material Science, and Physics. Teams pass the preliminary and regional rounds by competing with other teams in the same subject area. Those that pass both rounds compete against all other teams in the final round.

Winners of YSC Thailand constitute less than 4% of registered participants and qualify to compete in the prestigious Regeneron ISEF Competition in May.
