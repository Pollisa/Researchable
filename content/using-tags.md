iGEM is an international competition of research projects in synthetic biology. 

The competition’s main event is the Giant Jamboree, where thousands of students gather in Boston during the fall to present their research. While the competition is designed for undergraduate students, high school students are welcome to join and are placed in their own track. An integral part of iGEM is project presentation, so be prepared to make a wiki (website), posters, a video, and presentation slides beyond your research paper. 

## What to Know

When you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with `News` and other posts with `Cycling`, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on `/tag/news/` and `/tag/cycling/`, respectively.

If you tag a post with both `News` *and* `Cycling` - then it appears in both sections.

Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages and [hopefully soon](https://github.com/empress/empress-blog/issues/1) will support their own cover images and meta data.

Level: international
Timeline: March through October (But we recommend starting in January!)
Team Members: 2+ high school/collegiate (Most teams have 8-15 members)


## Tips

1. Plan your research idea early in the year and choose teammates wisely. 

2. Don’t make up your team of rising seniors only! The Giant Jamboree in Boston takes place around the BMAT test date and the US early application due date. 

3. It is a good idea to have members specializing in different areas, such as having a computer person code the wiki, an art person make the posters, and an event person lead public outreach. 
 
4. If you need ideas for your project, all past iGEM projects are uploaded to the website.
