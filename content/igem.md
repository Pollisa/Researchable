iGEM is an annual competition featuring research projects in synthetic biology from around the world. 

## What to Know
+ Level: International
+ Timeline: March through October (But we recommend starting in January!)
+ Team Members: 2+ High school/Collegiate (Most teams have 8-15 members)
+ [Visit the iGEM website](https://igem.org/).
+ [Browse iGEM 2021](https://2021.igem.org/Main_Page).

The competition’s main event is the Giant Jamboree, where thousands of students gather in Boston during the fall to present their research. While the competition is designed for undergraduate students, high school students are welcome to join and are placed in their own track. An integral part of iGEM is project presentation, so participants should be prepared to create wikis, posters, videos, and presentation slides beyond your research paper. 


## Tips

+ Plan your research idea early in the year! Every team is bound to experience scheduling conflicts, shipping delays, and miscommunication with professors. Aim to begin diving into your research as soon as the school year ends.
+ If you have rising seniors your team, be aware that the Giant Jamboree in Boston takes place around the same time as a BMAT test administration and the US early application due date. 
+ iGEM projects expect a lot more than just research – to earn a gold medal, you need to collaborate with other teams, contribute to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, and communicate with the public. It is a good idea to have members specializing in different areas, such as having a computer person coding the wiki, an art person designing posters, and an event person leading public outreach. 
+ If you coming up with a project idea, you can view all past iGEM projects on the iGEM website. Lots of teams indicate how to build on their research on their wikis.
