iGEM is an annual competition featuring research projects in synthetic biology from around the world. 

The competition’s main event is the Giant Jamboree, where thousands of students gather in Boston during the fall to present their research. While the competition is designed for undergraduate students, high school students are welcome to join and are placed in their own track. An integral part of iGEM is project presentation, so participants should be prepared to create wikis, posters, videos, and presentation slides beyond your research paper. 

## What to Know

+ Level: international
+ Timeline: March through October (But we recommend starting in January!)
+ Team Members: 2+ high school/collegiate (Most teams have 8-15 members)
+ Visit: [iGEM website](https://igem.org/).


## Tips

+ Plan your research idea early in the year and choose your teammates wisely. 
+ Be aware that the Giant Jamboree in Boston takes place around the same time as a BMAT test administration and the US early application due date. 
+ It is a good idea to have members specializing in different areas, such as having a computer person coding the wiki, an art person designing posters, and an event person leading public outreach. 
+ If you need help thinking of your project idea, you can view all past iGEM projects on the iGEM website. Lots of project wikis indicate how to build on their research.
